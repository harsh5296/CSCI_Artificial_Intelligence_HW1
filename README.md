"# CSCI_Artificial_Intelligence_HW1" 
 
 This was a graded AI assignment during my masters in the First Semester. 
 
 You can read the problem statement in the PDF.
 
 It was basically a modification of N-queen problem and had to implemented it using 3 algorithms under given time constraints :
 
 1. DFS
 2. BFS
 3. Simulated annealing 
 
 Reading input from file could have been much simpler, but was running out of time, so couldn't spend much time on it. Please , bare with me .
